Kubernetes is Orchestration open source platform  #[orchestration=automation]
Alternate of kubernetes is Openshift
           openshift is developed by RedHat
           Kubernetes is developed by google and it is written on " go language"

Docker is a Containerization
Kubernetes is a Orchestration , >> it creates containers to deploy application with a with an additional layer on containers known as pods

POD= it is a wrapper on top of the container (abstraction layer of container)

one pod can contain one container or many containers
these pods are deployed in nodes [nodes= server (ec2)]


--------------Kubernetes Types---------------
>> Cloud Managed Kubernetes 
           EKS : Elastic Kubernetes Service -AWS
           AKS : Azure Kubernetes Service  - Azure
           GKE : Google Kubernetes Engine  - GCP
     Control Plane is managed by Cloud Operators
     Worker Nodes are managed by the user himself
>> KOPS
      User managed kubernetes on cloud
      user is only responsible for both control plane and worker nodes
>> KUBEDM
     Suitable for on-prem Process



------------------Kubernetes Nodes-------------
Control Plane or Master Node    >> Controls worker node
Worker Node            >> used to deploy pods


------------Kubernetes Components---------------------
>> Client : who interact to kubernetes cluster   [kubectl comand]

>> API Server  : when we interact with kubernetes cluster using "kubectl" command-line interface, we are actually communicating with the master api server component
                  API Server is the only kubernetes component that connects to "etcd" 
                   all other components mustgo through the API Server to work with cluster state

>> etcd :  it reliably stores the configuration data of the kubernetes cluster
