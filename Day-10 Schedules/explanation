pod schedule : default pod schedule is taken care by the scheduler as per resource availability

>> Node Selector : it is the simplest form recommended form of node selection constraint
---------------first label the node---------------------    
#kubectl label node <nodename> <labelkey>=<labelvalue>        labelkey and label value can be of anything of our choice but it should match with the nodeselector section mentioned in the "yaml file"
node selector section in the yaml file is mentioned under the specifications of container
spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx
      nodeSelector:
        clr: pink
clr= labelkey
pink=labelvalue


-------------------------unlabel the node---------------------------
#kubectl label node <nodename> <labelkey>=<labelvalue>-



>> Deamonset : no selection of nodes, and replica concept pod number depends on node number 
               pods will create based on number of nodes


>> Node affinity preferred [preferred=prority] : preferred during scheduling ignored during execution





>> Node affinity required [required=mandatory] : required during scheduling ignored during execution
